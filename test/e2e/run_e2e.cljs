  "Real-browser E2E proof for org-w3-webaudio + kotoba-lang/audio: compiles
   the two bundles (scripts/build-e2e-bundles.sh), serves test/e2e/page/ over
   HTTP (Web Audio / AudioWorklet require a secure context -- about:blank/
   file: do not expose audioWorklet), drives a real headless Chromium via
   Playwright, loads the worklet DSP bundle into a real AudioWorkletProcessor
   via ctx.audioWorklet.addModule + AudioWorkletNode, renders it through an
   OfflineAudioContext, captures the actual PCM samples, and compares them
   against kotoba-lang/audio's OWN offline render of the identical note
   parameters (computed independently, right here, via audio.synth --
   requires -cp pointing at a checkout of kotoba-lang/audio, see
   AUDIO_SRC_PATH below).

   Requires: `bash scripts/build-e2e-bundles.sh` run first, and
   `npm install` inside test/e2e/ for the Playwright dependency.

   Run from the repo root:
     nbb -cp \"$AUDIO_SRC_PATH\" test/e2e/run_e2e.cljs"
